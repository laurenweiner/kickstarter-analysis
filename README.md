# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
GW Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 1: VBA

Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

**Overview of Project**

The purpose of this analysis was to determine how best design a kickstarter campaign for maximum success. I studied various data points, including the goal amount of kickstarter campaigns and the types of activities they funded. 

**Analysis and Challenges**

I performed this analysis using various Excel tools and formulas. I used Pivot Tables to summarize the data and formulas such as VLOOKUP and AVERAGE. One challenge I had was on the Outcomes Based on Goals section; I had missed a goal range when following the setup from BootcampSpot and my graph did not look like the one displayed. It took me a while to troubleshoot and figure out that I missed a range, but I learned more about my dataset along the way.

**Results**

Two conclusions I can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date are: 1) There are higher levels of success in the spring and summer months, possibly because people are looking for more activities to do during the summer, and 2) The winter months are the least successful for launching theater campaigns, likely because people are spending money on holiday gifts and other holiday spending.

A conclusion I can draw about Outcomes Based on Goals is that kickstarters are mainly successful when the goal is less than $5,000 or between $35,000 and $45,000.

A major limitiation with the dataset is that there is no information on the success of the activities once they received funding; There is no data to support whether the activities witht the most funding are exponentially more successful than those with less funding.

Another graph we could make is Staff Pick vs. Outcome. This graph shows that a higher percentage of those that were successful were "staff picks."
